A command line based mailing system written in Python.
Was a fun side project.

HOW TO USE PYMAIL - STEP BY STEP
(ONLY WINDOWS)

How to set up pymail:
1 - Go to www.gmail.com and create a brand new Gmail Account, I recommend setting a false nickname for this account.
2 - When having created an account, click on your account and click "Manage your google account".
3 - Go to the tab "Security".
4 - Click on 2step verification and scroll all the way down.
5 - You will see "App-passwords", click on it.
6 - Make a new "App-password", give it a name like "SMTP".
7 - Copy the password that Google provides and put it in a document (If you forget this password you need to create one again).
8 - click on main.exe
9 - Enter the email adress when prompted.
10 - Paste the password Google provided (or leave this field empty to enter it manually everytime)
11 - You can now send an email from everywhere.

How to use attachments:
You will notice that PyMail will prompt you with an option to send attachments (confirm/deny)
When you type confirm make sure you have the following
1 - Add all the attachments you want to send to a zip file
2 - Rename this zip file to "attachment.zip"
3 - put this zip folder in a the folder named attachments
4 - Set up your email now and when the prompt comes up enter "confirm"
5 - PyMail will now send the email with the zip file attached.
Sending large attachments could cause longer loading times.

When to use PyMail:
Imagine that you are on someone elses computer and that you can not log in for whatever reason, that is where PyMail comes in.
Put all the PyMail folders on a USB stick and simply open up the program to get it running.
Set up your email and attach relevant files to send an email to your personal email or a friend.
You can use this program pretty much everywhere as long as you have set it up correctly and have an internet connection.
